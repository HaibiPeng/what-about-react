## Build A React

Based on tutorial from ***Rodrigo Pombo***: https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/

Starting from scratch, these are all the things that are add to a simple version of React one by one:

* Step I: The createElement Function
* Step II: The render Function
* Step III: Concurrent Mode
* Step IV: Fibers
* Step V: Render and Commit Phases
* Step VI: Reconciliation
* Step VII: Function Components
* Step VIII: Hooks

### What can be next steps:
1. More hooks: useEffect, useContext, ...
2. Modify diff algorithm
3. Add or modify more features, e.g., from https://github.com/chinanf-boy/didact-explain

## More to come...
